# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setting up

### Clone the repository

Go to terminal and clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/adoalvarez/ado-referral-builder.git`.

### Go to clone file and install dependencies

Head to clone directory using `cd ado-referral-build`. \
Make sure to install dependencies to be able to run the app. \
use `npm i` or `npm install`

### `npm start-dev`

This will run both backend and frontend app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. \
Open [http://localhost:3001/api/referrals](http://localhost:3001/api/referrals) to view get api


## Notes

I used express for backend and just a json file for storing data since setting up its own DB would be overkill. \
I haven't added other functionalities in the app such as add avatar and validations.

## Time consumed building the app

It takes 3 days to build. 4-5 hrs a day to finish the project. \

1st day - I worked with the frontend part of the project\
2nd day - I worked with the backend part \
3rd day - I integrate the backend into frontend.\
